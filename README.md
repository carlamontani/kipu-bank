# KipuBank üè¶

## Description

`KipuBank` is a smart contract that functions as a decentralized bank on the Ethereum network, allowing users to deposit and withdraw Ether (ETH). The contract enforces transaction limits and manages individual user balances.

Key features include:

* **Deposit Functionality**: Users can deposit ETH into a personal vault within the contract. üí∞
* **Withdrawal Limits**: A maximum withdrawal amount is enforced per transaction to mitigate risk. üí∏
* **Global Capacity Cap**: The total amount of ETH held by the contract is capped to prevent over-liquidation. üìä
* **Balance Tracking**: Each user's balance and transaction history are securely tracked. üìù
* **Secure ETH Handling**: It includes safe calls for ETH transfers to prevent common re-entrancy attacks. üîí

## Contract on Sepolia Testnet

This contract has been deployed on the Sepolia testnet. You can view it and interact with it on Etherscan at the following address:

## Deployment Instructions

These instructions assume you are using an online IDE like Remix.

### Prerequisites

* A wallet configured with a connection to an Ethereum network (e.g., MetaMask).
* Testnet ETH (e.g., Sepolia ETH) for deployment.

### Using Remix

1. **Open Remix IDE**: Navigate to `remix.ethereum.org`.
2. **Create a New File**: Click the "+" icon to create a new file named `KipuBank.sol`.
3. **Paste the Code**: Copy and paste the provided `KipuBank.sol` contract code into the file.
4. **Compile the Contract**: Go to the "Solidity Compiler" tab. Ensure the compiler version is set to `0.8.0` or higher and click **Compile `KipuBank.sol`**.
5. **Deploy the Contract**:
    * Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab (the icon that looks like an Ethereum logo).
    * In the "Environment" dropdown, select **Injected Provider - MetaMask**. Connect your wallet to the desired network (e.g., Sepolia testnet).
    * In the "Deploy" section, you will see the `KipuBank` contract.
    * Enter the `_bankCap` value (the maximum total amount the bank can hold) in the constructor input field. For example, `50000000000000000000`,which is 50 ETH.
    * Click **Deploy** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

## How to Interact with the Contract

After deployment, you can interact with the contract's public functions using a block explorer like Etherscan or through your development environment.

### Deposit

* **Via `Deposit()`**: Call the `Deposit` function and attach the amount of ETH you wish to send. This achieves the same result as the `receive` function.

### Withdrawal

* **Function**: `Withdrawal(uint256 amount)`
* **Description**: This function allows a user to withdraw a specified `amount` of ETH from their balance. The maximum is 5 ETH per transaction.
* **Parameters**: `amount` (uint256) - The amount of ETH to withdraw in wei.
* **Example**: To withdraw 1 ETH, you would call `Withdrawal` with the value `1000000000000000000`.

### View Functions

* `GetBalance(address account)`: Check the ETH balance of any `account` within the bank.
* `GetDepositCount(address account)`: Get the total number of deposits made by a specific `account`.
* `GetWithdrawalCount(address account)`: Get the total number of withdrawals made by a specific `account`.
